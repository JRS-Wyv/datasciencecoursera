Required assignment for Coursera

As the above line says, this is an attempt to learn Git, Github, and ultimately, R.

Not as easy as it seems at first, I have to say.  First init, then remote add, then file creation, then add, 
then commit (don't forget -a), then push (don't forget --all)

!Rejection, alas.  I forgot to pull.  Eh?  Nobody said anything about "pull" that I remembered...hmm.

Search help files... Man, this stuff is harder to read than I remember the old unix "man" pages being, but
that was a long time ago.

Aha - pull --all!  Yes.  Now start over.

Finally, success.

Read enough in this readme?  I be no one will read it but me anyway.  Hah!
